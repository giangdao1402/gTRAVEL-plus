# gTRAVEL+: Enhancing Ground Segmentation using 3D LiDAR with Temporal Noise Removal and Adaptive Plane Fitting for Urban and Off-Road Environments
gTRAVEL+ is an improvement of [**TRAVEL**](https://github.com/url-kaist/TRAVEL) that focuses exclusively on enhancing ground segmentation performance.  
## üîç Overview  
![TRAVEL++ Overview](assets/overview.png)
gTRAVEL+ introduces:  
- **Temporal Node-Wise Noise Removal (TNNR)** to eliminate noise.  
- **Merge Node Plane Fitting (MNPF)** to tackle the under-segmentation issue caused by inappropriate region size.  
- **Rejected Ground Node Revert (RNGR)** to recover misclassified ground points. 
## üìä Results  
This method achieves **state-of-the-art segmentation** performance on urban (SemanticKITTI) and off-road (Rellis-3D) datasets.

## üì¢ Stay Tuned! Our code will be available upon acceptance.
