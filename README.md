# gTRAVEL+: Enhancing Ground Segmentation using 3D LiDAR with Temporal Noise Removal and Adaptive Plane Fitting for Urban and Off-Road Environments
gTRAVEL+ is an improvement of [**TRAVEL**](https://github.com/url-kaist/TRAVEL) that focuses exclusively on enhancing ground segmentation performance.  
## üîç Overview  
![TRAVEL++ Overview](assets/overview.png)
gTRAVEL+ introduces:  
- **Temporal Node-Wise Noise Removal (TNNR)** to eliminate noise.  
- **Merge Node Plane Fitting (MNPF)** to tackle the under-segmentation issue caused by inappropriate region size.  
- **Rejected Ground Node Revert (RNGR)** to recover misclassified ground points. 
## :gear: How to build gTRAVEL+
1. **Dependencies**  
You need to install all the dependencies of the baseline method [**TRAVEL**](https://github.com/url-kaist/TRAVEL).
2. **Build**  
To successfully build gTRAVEL+, you can follow the commands below:
```bash
$ mkdir -p catkin_ws/src
$ cd catkin_ws/src
$ git clone https://github.com/giangdao1402/gTRAVEL-plus
$ ../
$ catkin build  # or catkin_make
```
## :running: How to run gTRAVEL+
```bash
$ cd catkin_ws
$ source devel/setup.bash
$ roslaunch gtravelp run_rellis.launch data_dir:=/media/giang/SSD/rosbag/SematicKITTI/Rellis_3D_os1_cloud_node_kitti_bin/Rellis-3D/00000 rviz:=True
 # or run_kitti.launch with data_dir of kitti bin
```

## üìä Results  
This method achieves **state-of-the-art segmentation** performance on urban (SemanticKITTI) and off-road (Rellis-3D) datasets.
